I attended the 6th Annual [Nebraska.Code()](http://nebraskacode.com) conference in Lincoln, NE on May 18th-20th. I gave three talks and, as usual, [Adam Barney](https://twitter.com/cabarney) and [Ken Versaw](https://twitter.com/kversaw1) knocked it out of the park. Every year, Nebraska.Code() raises the bar on what's possible for a conference that doesn't charge an arm and a leg to attend.

The Venue
==
This year's conference returned to the [NIC Conference Center](http://innovate.unl.edu/nic-conference-center). The conference space is outstanding. It is arranged in a pretty easy-to-navigate pattern, making it easy to find the session you want to go to, and the big space upstairs is ideal for dining and hanging out and working. It is compact without being crowded and accessible for everyone.

The Conference
==
The conference sessions brought together some of the [best and brightest](http://nebraskacode.com/speakers) in the midwest (yours truly, notwithstanding) to share [their knowledge](http://nebraskacode.com/sessions), with attendees eager to engage. I always have a great time speaking in Lincoln, and always have excellent conversations in the hallways and conference events.

The Attendee Party

The attendee party was held at [Rule G Night Club](http://rulegnightclub.com), a quaint and sophisticated bar mostly located on a covered rooftop. The weather was fantastic; sunny, but not too hot. The Nebraska Code team had managed to book a "Karaoke Band" called [Jacked](https://www.facebook.com/jackedomaha) to play at the party. Attendees signed up to sing and/or play an instrument with the band and everyone rocked the house. It was definitely NOT your typical, stand-around-drink-cocktails kind of party.

The Talks
==
As stated, I gave three talks at the conference: JavaScript Level-Up, Consuming Hypermedia in AngularJS and Real Agile: The Stuff the Books Don't Tell You. While all seemed well received, the Agile talk garnered the most interaction. Mostly because it is MEANT to be an interactive session, but also because there are a lot of places where I encourage folks to ask questions or share their experiences with a specific topic.

The JavaScript Level-Up talk is fun to give, and always evolving. As I pick up new techniques, the "Tips and Tricks" section grows. I always see a lot of nodding and eye-opening during the session, because folks almost always see either something totally new to them, or an explanation of why something they've observed happening happens.

The Consuming Hypermedia in AngularJS talk is always a crap shoot. This time giving it, I forgot to open the demo project that showed of the results first, so when I dove into the code that produces the result it was more abstract than it would've been had I shown the demo first. Which caused a kind of "herky jerky" section in the middle where I had to stop and find the project and open it and go back a little to concrete product of the practice, and then head back to explaining the code. I also always expect some skeptics and questions that I don't have good answers for; mostly because this is something hardly anyone does. I'm okay with that. Mostly, I want to get more people thinking about the Hypermedia part of the ReST specification and how to owork it into their daily work flow.

Overall
==
Overall, another outstanding year for [Nebraska.Code()](https://www.facebook.com/nebraskacode)! I had a blast and will keep coming back as long as they'll have me (and probably a couple more years after that!). Thanks again, to Adam and Ken for all the hard work that goes into putting together such a stong conference as [Nebraska.Code()](https://twitter.com/NebraskaCC)!
